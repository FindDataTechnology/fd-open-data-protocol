"""Run the ontology conformance gate against this repo's own adapter.

Standalone-checkout entry point. The workspace-root
``scripts/ontology_conformance_gate.py`` cannot be used from CI: each repo is
checked out on its own, and the kernel has **no git remote** to fetch (it is not
a git repository). So each surface keeps a one-entry registry next to itself
(``ontology-adapter.json``) and this launcher pins it.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/ontology_gate.py            # check this repo's adapter
    python3 scripts/ontology_gate.py --list     # what is registered here
    python3 scripts/ontology_gate.py --adapter fd-open-data-protocol

Exit codes are the gate's: ``0`` passed, ``1`` violations (each printed with its
fix), ``2`` the gate could not run.
